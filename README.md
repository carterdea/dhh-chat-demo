## DHH Chat Demo

I wanted to play around with Action Cable so I followed DHH's chat demo on his medium (https://github.com/carterdea/dhh-chat-demo.git). I'm very impressed. It's really nice and simple.

Things I should cover here:
* Ruby 2.3.0
* Rails 5.0.0.beta3
* Redis for Prod
* SQLite
* Something for jobs (not sure what, lol)
